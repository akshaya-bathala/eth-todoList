# Ethereum To-Do List

A decentralized task management system built on the Ethereum blockchain.

## About the Project
This project utilizes smart contracts to create, manage, and track tasks in a secure, transparent, and immutable manner. By leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, we ensure data integrity and trust among users.

## Technologies Used
- Ethereum Blockchain: Decentralized platform for task management
- Solidity: Smart contract programming language
- Web3.js: Library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain

## Features
- Decentralized Storage: Tasks stored on the Ethereum blockchain
- Smart Contract: Automated task management logic
- Immutable: Task records are permanent and tamper-proof
- Transparent: All task-related activities are transparent

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies 
3. Deploy smart contract to Ethereum network
4. Interact with the To-Do List through the user interface

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Please submit pull requests or issues to improve the project.
